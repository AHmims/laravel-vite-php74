# Configuration

There is a distinction between configuring Vite and configuring Laravel Vite. 

The former is done in the `vite.config.ts` file: that's where you define Vite and Rollup plugins, for instance. 

The latter is done in `config/vite.php`, where you can set up aliases, commands that run before starting Vite, and [define other configurations](/guide/multiple-configurations).
